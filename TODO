Figure out how to license stuff properly.  GPL?  LGPL?  BSD?  What does it all mean?

Do some more testing on some other platforms.

Provide some scripts for fleshing out the mkiniramfs/ tree.  i.e. build busybox and stick it inside with necessary directories and config files and stuff.

Keep moving!
