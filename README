build.sh:

This is the main build script.  Edit it up.  A couple useful statements:
./build.sh clean - cleans out the build and dest directories
./build.sh strip - strips cruft a la LFS step 5.34
./build.sh package - packages the dest/tools directory into a squashfs image

config:

This holds all the constants for the build.  It is designed to be run out of this directory, but you can change the INFIMUM_HOME=`pwd` to some other directory if you like.

dummy.c:

A dummy C source file for sanity checks a la LFS
	<gcc to test> [-B<lib>] dummy.c
	readelf -l a.out | grep tools
This should give you /tools/lib64/ld-linux-$ARCH.so.2 (at this time).  Support for other libc libraries will follow.

mkinitramfs.sh:

A script that will take anything in the mkinitramfs directory and package it into an initramfs image.
It is currently hard-coded to a particular kernel in my home directory, so please change it to your own.

scripts:

This directory contains the bulk of scriptlets for everything.  Right now it contains scripts just for the stage 1 part of LFS.
I would rather package the stage 1 for building in a QEMU vs chroot environment.

test.sh:
This runs a QEMU emulator.  Right now it expects a kernel built separately (since I haven't gotten to packaging it yet).
And again, it uses a hard-coded link to a kernel.  Edit as you please.
